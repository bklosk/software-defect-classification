# Kaggle Competition: Binary Classification with a Software Defects Dataset
Predicting the failure of programs written in C from descriptive Halstead and McCabe metrics

This competition requires the competitor to generate a probit classification model and report the outcome.
I generate a robust pipeline for generating an ensemble model. Clever feature engineering is key here.
K-folds validation is used to evaluate accuracy, since that is the metric the competition is judged on.
